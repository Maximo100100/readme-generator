## Description 

Readme Generator is a node.js app that helps you produce a professional readme for your project. It accomplishes this by getting the user inputs from the command line using the Inquirer package from npm. It then plugs in the inputs from the object produced by inquirer into a function that returns raw markdown code. Finally it writes that data to a file called Readme.md in the **produced_readme** folder.

## Usage 

to use this app, navigate to the root of the app and run `node index.js` the app will then prompt you with questions like the title of your project and will ask you to input fields that will later be writen to your finished readme file. You can also leave the field blank and later remove it from the finished readme if you dont want to include certain sections.
